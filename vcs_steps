module load synopsys/vcs

vcs -full64 -debug_all -f vcs_master
(vcs_master should contain all the files that need to be run)

./simv
(This will actually run the testbench. Currently, top.v is instantiating the ripple carry adder and I am passing inputs in the initial block)
dve -full64
(This will help you look at the waveform. Go to File-> open database-> open the top.dump.vpd)

This will be helpful

Create appropriate directories inside lib/ for reusable verilog
For actual functionality, we can create a components at the top, parallel to testbenches and lib and inside components, have all our files.
